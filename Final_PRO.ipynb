We then choose the feature with the greatest accuracy and set it as our tree root.\n",

You don’t really need to worry about the algorithm, the only difference is, in the “best” splitter it evaluate all splits using the criterion before splitting whereas the “random” splitter uses a random uniform function with min_feature_value, max_feature_value and random_state as inputs.

Note here that it is the number of training samples and not the number of features because the data can be split on the same feature multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s first talk about the default None case, if you don’t specify a depth for the tree, scikit-learn will expand the nodes until all leaves are pure, meaning the leaf will only have labels if you choose default for the min_samples_leaf, where the default value is one. Note that most of these hyperparameters are tied to one another and we will talk about the min_samples_leaf shortly. On the other hand, if you specify a min_samples_split, which we will look at next, the nodes will be expanded until all leaves contain less than the minimum number of samples"
